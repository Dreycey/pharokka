pharokka creates a number of output files in different formats.

The main file pharokka generates is pharokka.gff, which is a gff3 format file including the fasta following the gff table annotations.

This file can be used by programs such as Roary to generate pangenomes.

pharokka also creates pharokka.tbl, which is a flat-file table suitable to be unploaded to the NCBI's Bankit.
